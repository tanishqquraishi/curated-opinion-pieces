# Curated Opinion Pieces
In order to run Parsing Through (my personal Instagram writing, reading and reviewing blog), it's important for me to stay up to date with the latest trending
opinion pieces on the internet.

In order to do this, I decided to automate my enjoyable Substack reading. The goal is to curate well-discussed, trending opinion pieces on Substack, by
minimizing my scroll and discovery time and increasing my reading time. 

My overarching goal is to create more than I consume this 2025. This project is a part of that.
